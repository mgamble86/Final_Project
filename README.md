Final project repository for EEB 

#This project will be used to import fish abundance data, seperate it by species, time and age class, then export the data into a .csv format in order to be analyzed against sea lion data (blubber, disease, etc...), and possibly weather anomoly data.

#This project currently consists of only preliminary pseudocode.
